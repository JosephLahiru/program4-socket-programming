## Performance Report: Client-Server Program Testing

1. Introduction
   This report presents the results of performance tests conducted on a client-server program. The main objective of these tests was to measure the throughput (bps) of the program under various configurations, including different buffer sizes, numbers of buffers, and types of operations.

2. Test Environment and Setup
   The tests were conducted in a controlled lab environment, using separate nodes for running the client and server executables. The program was compiled using the appropriate compiler and settings to ensure optimal performance.

3. Test Scenarios
   Four test scenarios were executed, with varying combinations of nbufs, bufsize, and type. These combinations are listed below:

- Test 1: nbufs=15, bufsize=100
- Test 2: nbufs=30, bufsize=50
- Test 3: nbufs=60, bufsize=25
- Test 4: nbufs=100, bufsize=15

For each test scenario, three types of operations were performed:

- Type 1
- Type 2
- Type 3

4. Results and Analysis
   The average throughput for each test scenario and operation type was calculated. The results are presented in the table below:

Test Scenario Type 1 Throughput Type 2 Throughput Type 3 Throughput
Test 1
Test 2
Test 3
Test 4

Based on the results, it can be observed that [insert trends or patterns]. The performance differences between the test types and buffer size combinations can be attributed to [insert reasons].

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the performance tests conducted on the client-server program provided valuable insights into the program's throughput under various configurations. The analysis of the results revealed trends and patterns that can be used to optimize the program's performance. Future work may include conducting additional tests with different parameters to further investigate the impact of various factors on the program's performance.
